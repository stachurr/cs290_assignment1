    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>
        During this assignment, I found it rather annoying to get cloning quite difficult. I use Atom,
        which has GitHub integration and allows for cloning and other commands. After a while I
        finally got Atom to correctly clone the assignment repository. Other than issues with using
        a repository and it's commands, I only had issues remembering how to set up HTML elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        I already learned from previous experience what most html elements are and how they work, so
        the only new topic for me thus far is git and how to maintain a repository on GitHub.
