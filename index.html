    <h2>Scale of Confidence</h2>
    <p>On a scale from 0-10, I am around a 5. I have made a few local websites with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript (a long time ago).</p>

    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>I hope to learn how to maintain a website, as well as understand how to make webpages secure.</p>

    <h2>Piazza</h2>
    <p>yeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My body is trying to kill me. I had a tumor in my neck when I was born, my tonsils bled into my stomach, and of recently, one of my lungs decided to rip open.</p>
